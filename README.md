This is going to be the next sharp site, Right now we have a wix site and its pretty ugly and not very functional. 
Our goal is to get this to be nice and pretty with the intention of getting more drivers. 

Odvialusy we need to figure out hosting and things but I changing the domains should be pretty easy and I donno if we will still host with vercel or not but they really do make it so easy.

Hosting on vercel.
